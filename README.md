Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a draft of a webpage about my hobbies and I; a little egocentric I know.
  index.html is a lobby sort of thing that should guide the user to any of then
  three existing sections

  reviews.html is where I post my reviews of books. These I reviews I had written
  some time ago for Goodreads and thought could be better than the classic lorem ipsum fillers

  recipes.html is where I post my recipes, currently only the one.
  Do recommend you try it!

  aboutme.html is where I have written some short non-serious description of me
  and why this site even exists. Note the literary easter egg for the fellow book-worm
