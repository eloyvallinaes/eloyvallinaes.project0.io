              <h3>French omelette my way</h3>
              <h5>January 20th, 2020</h6>
                <p>
                  French omelttes are a relieable dinner for any student with little
                  time to spare. Here is a way to elevate your omelette a touch
                  with cupboard basics and a little care.
                </p>
                <h6>Ingredients (serves 1)</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Eggs: 2</li>
                  <li>Slice of ham: 1</li>
                  <li>Slice of cheese: 1</li>
                  <li>A splash of milk</li>
                  <li>A scoop of butter</li>
                  <li>Salt</li>
                  <li>Pepper</li>
                  <li>Basil</li>
                  <li>Oregano</li>
                  <li>Thyme</li>
                  <li>Parsley</li>
                </ul>
              <h6>Steps</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Mix eggs, milk, herbs, salt and pepper in a bowl and whip until
                  slightly foamy and well integrated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Melt in a pan over high heat and spread over the whole surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add eggy mix from step 1 to the pan and inmediately turn heat down
                  to medium
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the mix has settled, add the slice of cheese and cover width
                  the slice of ham on one half of the omelette.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Try to lift the omelette from the pan with a spatula. When you see
                  that the bottom side is slightly brown, fold along the middle of the
                  omelette onto the half with the ham and the cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Serve with extra parsley and enjoy!
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                As the title suggest, <i>The New York trilogy</i> is a collection
                of three short books that are commonly published together but were
                in fact written on separate years by American author Paul Auster.
                While chracters and stories change from one story to the next, all
                three are about detectives and have the themes of identity and reality
                as <i>leit motiv</i>. Charicaturesque and weird at times, this is
                not a book for everyone.
