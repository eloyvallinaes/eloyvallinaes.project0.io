              <h3>Daisy Jones and The Six</h3>
              <h5>Taylor Jenkins Reid</h5>
              <h6>March 4th, 2020</h4>
                <p>
                  <i>Daisy Jones is a neglected teenager from a rich family that turns to
                    drugs and bad men in her endless quest for attention, while in possession
                    of an unparalleled musical talent that could make everything alright,
                    if only she was properly heard. Billy Dunne is a sensitive, attractive young man,
                    son to an absent father, who pours himself into music.</i>
                    Well if that sounded a little trite to you, that makes two of us.
                    Add to that Billy’s less-talented-more-likeable brother, Daisy’s selfless BFF,
                    the band’s unrecognised keyboardist, a producer convinced of these people’s potential
                    and capable of managing everyone’s egos, plus a cohort of unimportant group members,
                    with more or less plain personalities. Now, spice everything up by name-dropping
                    some drugs and throw in a couple of sex stories, cook for some 400 pages
                    and you’ll have something very similar to <i>Daisy Jones & The Six</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don’t get me wrong, the book undeniably works; it makes for an engaging
                  read and a few cackles. However, the plot unfolded rather predictably,
                  except for the identity of the narrator, which I just didn’t care for;
                  and the characters felt mostly irreflexive, or were simply too
                  inarticulate, about their own actions, even from the vantage point of
                  what would have been a couple decades’ hindsight. Notable exceptions
                  could be Camila’s and Karen’s stories, as well as Billy’s struggle
                  with addiction; but all three are truly only touched upon, discussed
                  only superficially, and left for the reader to fill in the narrative
                  blanks with what, at least for the least informed of us, will
                  inevitably be more clichés.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All in all, the story between Billy and Daisy was quite touching and
                  one can only wish their music existed, but for the Goodreads
                  Choice Winner in Historical Fiction 2019, this was just not
                  particularly memorable.

              <h3>A Confederacy of Dunces</h3>
              <h5>John Kennedy Toole</h5>
              <h6>February 14th, 2020</h4>
              <p>
                Even though the out-loud laughter that is promised in this book's
                numerous reviews eluded me, I did find myself grinning at it, and
                even conceded the occasional snort. However, some of the humour
                has aged quite drastically since the 1960's, and I couldn't help
                but feel that the lives of so many of the characters were actually
                tragic, which spoiled part of the fun.

              <h3>The New York Trilogy</h3>
              <h5>Paul Auster</h5>
              <h6>January 13th, 2020</h6>
              <p>
                As the title suggest, <i>The New York trilogy</i> is a collection
                of three short books that are commonly published together but were
                in fact written on separate years by American author Paul Auster.
                While chracters and stories change from one story to the next, all
                three are about detectives and have the themes of identity and reality
                as <i>leit motiv</i>. Charicaturesque and weird at times, this is
                not a book for everyone.
