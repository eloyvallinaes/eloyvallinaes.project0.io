              <h3>Who am I?</h3>
              <p>
                My name is Elroy Vanilla. That is not my real name.
                I am orginally from Spain but I have been living in Sweden for 4 years now,
                where I am doing a PhD in Biophysics.
              </p>
              <h3>Why this site?</h3>
              <p>
                I made this site in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic because I was taking a
                course in web development. I was hoping such a course would teach me how
                to make a web application for the explorarion of data obtained in my research;
                presented in an engaing and meaningful manner,
                filled with animations, interactivity and generally cool stuff.
              </p>
